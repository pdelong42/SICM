SICM
====

The Structure and Interpretation of Classical Mechanics, 2nd Ed.

Contained in this project are the exercises from the book of the same name.

I'm resurrecting this project since I bought the second edition of the book.

But first, I'm making a slight diversion into "Functional Differential
Geometry", which I bought in the same shipment/order (see "fdg.scm").

Update: I'm taking a break from FDG for now, because it's a bit over
my head, and seems to assume the reader has already been through SICM.
Nonetheless, it is interesting, and it motivated a few digressions
into reading-up on manifolds and related matters.
